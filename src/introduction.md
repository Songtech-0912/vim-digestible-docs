# Vim Personal Documentation

## Summary

What you are reading now is my personal **vim documentation**.

Whether this would be helpful is entirely and totally dependent on how much you use vim. If you're a typical user, then this might work for you. If you're more advanced, this guide is basically a children's book to you. And if you use vim like, once a year, then go figure the usefulness of such a guide to you.

Because of extensively working in vim (to the point of using it basically exclusively), I've made Vim my own playground. So be prepared to find unofficial code, messy references, and so on.

However, I'm releasing this to the community in hopes that others can remix and learn vim in a more relaxed way. You're free to do basically everything with this book. It's under a CC0 license, which makes it effectively public domain.

I have to thank all of the awesome developers of Vim and its plugins for giving me this amazing opportunity. And the creators of mdBook for making it so easy to share my experiences with everyone.

Without further ado, let's get into Vim! You'll learn everything I've ever learnt about Vim - and hopefully gain a fair share of respect for this unassuming yet powerful editor along the way.
